# car-worth-linear-regression

## In jupyter notebook

## Tasks Part 1
1. Find the linear regression equation for mileage vs price.
2. Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
3. Find the equation's $R^2$ score (use the `.score` method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)

## Tasks Part 2
1. Use mileage, cylinders, liters, doors, cruise, sound, and leather to find the linear regression equation.
2. Find the equation's $R^2$ score (use the `.score` method) to determine whether the
equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)
3. Find the combination of the factors that is the best predictor for price.

## Tasks Part 3
1. Research dummy variables in scikit-learn to see how to use the make, model, and body type.
2. Find the best combination of factors to predict price.
